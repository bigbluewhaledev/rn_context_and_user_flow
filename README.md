# React Native Context API and Good User Flow
A sample application that demonstrates using the React Context API to allow for good user flow 

## Key takeaways from this sample

1. Your architecture should not limit your ability to have good user flow. If a capability is hidden behind a mechanism of control, your architecture should be able to satisfy that control while maintaining the user's original intent.
2. The use of the Context API can be used to provide information through the application so it can react accordingly to a change in state and allow for the user flow intent to be satisfied.
